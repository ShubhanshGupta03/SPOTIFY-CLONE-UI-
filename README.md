# Spotify-Clone (UI)
This project is a front-end clone of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify, built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Spotifyâ€™s user interface, including the sidebar menu, album thumbnails, music player controls, and responsive layout. The project focuses on mastering layout design, positioning, Flexbox, Grid, and styling techniques to create a visually appealing music app interface. While it does not include actual audio playback or JavaScript functionality, it serves as a strong demonstration of UI development skills using pure HTML and CSS.
